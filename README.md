# Image Blur Tool

A simple tool to select and blur areas in an image using Tkinter and OpenCV.

## Introduction
Image Blur Tool is a utility designed to apply blur effects to selected areas of an image. Users can draw rectangular or circular regions on the image, which can then be blurred. The tool supports dynamic display of the selected areas and allows users to save and load processed images.
